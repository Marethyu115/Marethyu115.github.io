				According to moneymax.ph, an average of 20 typhoons hits our country, the Philippines every year. In addition to this, rains normally happen every month in the Philippines in which these floods devastate whatever they hit. Not only do these floods cause destruction to many properties, it also makes the bad traffic in the Philippines even worse!
Noting that our country is very poor, many of the poor use our bodies of water as their natural toilet. Whenâ€™s flood occur, some of the water from these bodies of water spread inland which may cause sickness. Rat urine, which causes Leptospirosis, may also rise from drainage canals when flooded.

Floods may also destroy the current work of others. Light floods may be good to the crops of farmers, but when the flood rises too high, it destroys the crops. Floods also ruin construction of many buildings because they carry away many of the materials needed such as cocrete powder.

				Generally speaking, these floods cause a lot of trouble in the Philippines, we think that this is one of our major problems and that we need to resolve it immediately. We propose that we build more drainage systems around residences. Along with this, we propose that security will be more strict with the disposal of trash since this is one of the main reasons of the clogging of drainages.

To avoid the destruction of property, we also propose that all new buildings will be constructed with an elevation of at least one meter and that all public buildings would have emergency rafts in case the flood rises too high. 

Nature may also help us in avoiding floods, more trees will be planted along roads. Not only will our environment be more beautiful, it will also be less prone to floods.
