				As students we need to go to school because we need to get a proper education so that we may have a proper future, for us and the society. A major hindrance to this is the inability for us to go to school as the bad conditions presented to us in the Philippines by the government is the bad public services.
				<br>
				This is why we thought of improving the systems given to us.
